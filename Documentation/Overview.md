## What is SGDynamicTextAssets?

SGDynamicTextAssets is an Unreal Engine plugin that provides a text-file-based data configuration system for static game data. It serves a similar role to Unreal's built-in Primary Data Assets, but stores data in external text files rather than `.uasset` binaries. This makes data human-readable, diffable in version control, and editable outside the Unreal Editor.

Dynamic text assets are ideal for game configuration that is defined by designers and consumed read-only at runtime: items, weapons, quests, dialogue, enemy stats, level metadata, and similar structured data.

## Why Not Primary Data Assets?

Primary Data Assets work well for many projects, but have limitations that SGDynamicTextAssets addresses:

| Concern | Primary Data Assets | SGDynamicTextAssets |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **File format** | Binary `.uasset` | Human-readable text (`.dta.json`, `.dta.xml`, `.dta.yaml`) |
| **Version control** | Binary diffs, merge conflicts | Text diffs, mergeable files |
| **External editing** | Requires Unreal Editor | Any text editor or tooling pipeline |
| **Identity** | Asset path (fragile) | Stable GUID (survives moves/renames) |
| **Server override** | Not built-in | Built-in server integration layer |
| **Packaged format** | Included in pak as uasset | Compressed `.dta.bin` with manifest |
| **Validation** | Manual | Built-in validation framework |
| **Migration** | Custom versioning | Semantic versioning with auto-migration |

## Core Design Principles

### Text Files as Source of Truth
All dynamic text assets are authored and stored as text files in the editor. The default format is JSON (`.dta.json`), with XML (`.dta.xml`) and YAML (`.dta.yaml`) also supported through the pluggable serializer architecture. Each file includes a metadata section (`type`, `version`, `id`, `userfacingid`) and a `data` section containing the serialized UPROPERTY fields. Binary `.dta.bin` files are produced only during cooking for packaged builds.

Custom serialization formats can be added by implementing the `ISGDynamicTextAssetSerializer` interface and registering the serializer during module startup. See [Serializer Interface](Serialization/SerializerInterface.md).

### GUID Identity
Every dynamic text asset has a unique `FSGDynamicTextAssetId` (a wrapper around `FGuid`) that never changes after creation. IDs are stable across renames, moves, and refactors. All references between assets use `FSGDynamicTextAssetId` rather than file paths, eliminating broken references when files are reorganized.

### Runtime Immutability
Dynamic text assets are read-only at runtime. They represent constant configuration data, not mutable game state. This simplifies caching, threading, and reasoning about data flow.

### Interface-Driven Design
The core contract is defined by the `ISGDynamicTextAssetProvider` interface. `USGDynamicTextAsset` is the default implementation, but any `UObject` that implements `ISGDynamicTextAssetProvider` can participate in the ecosystem. Registration guards prevent `AActor` and `UActorComponent` subclasses from being registered as providers.

### Soft References Only
Dynamic text assets use `FSGDynamicTextAssetRef` (a lightweight `FSGDynamicTextAssetId` wrapper) for cross-references. Hard reference UPROPERTYs (`TObjectPtr<>`, `TSubclassOf<>`) are prohibited at compile time by a UHT validator. Soft references (`TSoftObjectPtr`, `TSoftClassPtr`) can be tagged with named asset bundles for selective batch loading. Objects are loaded on-demand through the subsystem and resolved lazily.

### Separation of Concerns
The plugin is split into two modules:
- **SGDynamicTextAssetsRuntime** (`Runtime`, `PreDefault`): Core types, serialization, subsystem, file management. Ships in packaged builds.
- **SGDynamicTextAssetsEditor** (`Editor`, `Default`): Browser, editor, reference viewer, property customizations, cook pipeline, source control. Editor-only.

### Semantic Versioning
Each dynamic text asset carries an `FSGDynamicTextAssetVersion` (Major.Minor.Patch). Major version changes trigger the migration system, allowing old data to be automatically transformed to the current format.
